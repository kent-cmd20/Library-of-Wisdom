# The History of Git

1. **Created by Linus Torvalds**: Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the same person who started the Linux kernel.

2. **Speed and Integrity**: It was designed to be much faster than older systems like SVN and to ensure that data cannot be corrupted without the system knowing.

3. **Distributed System**: Unlike older tools, every developer has a full copy of the entire project history on their own computer, not just a central server.
